PyCity School Analysis - an assessment of school data 

Analysis was conducted of 15 different schools composed of charter schools and district schools. The schools varied in size from 427 students to 4,976. Yet their budgets were pretty close in amount ranging from $578 to $655 per student. A detailed analysis was conducted of math, reading and overall scores by school size and school type.
